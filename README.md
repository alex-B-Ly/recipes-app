RECIPES APP
===========

This is in its very early stages, and thus not completely functional yet.

## About this project

- Created to easily store and retrieve recipes.
- You need to run this on a server or functionality won't work.
- To store a new recipe, add a new object to whatever food type json file you want to store it in.  Follow the format of the examples, and add appropriate ID.  Back end functionality will be eventually be added, which will make this unnecessary.
